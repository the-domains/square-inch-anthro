There are many strategies for keeping your rear from touching the ground that I've seen. The classic around these parts has always been the "Bus Stop Squat" - the ability to squat is usually quite limited for those who haven't been doing it since birth, but inhabitants of countries with powerful monsoon season downpours seem to have a knack for it. Pictured here are two similar flavors of using your foot-wear in a new way.

I hadn't seen this strategy until recently, and I imagine the conditions have to be fairly unique for it to work, considering 1) shoes are seldom worn inside of buildings, meaning this practice doesn't work indoors and 2) rainwater running down sidewalks can easily lap over thin flip-flops and get your pants/longyi wet. Still, a good card to have in your sleeve for just the right time/sitting condition.
