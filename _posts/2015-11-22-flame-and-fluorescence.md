Choosing whether to light one's business by candle or fluorescent tube lamp is an important decision for vendors. For fluorescent lighting, if one is unable to "borrow" (or rent, as is usually the case) grid access from an adjacent building, then one must contribute for a share of the fuel and maintenance costs of a communally-run generator.

While candles lack lumens compared to a tube lamp, they make up for it in added functionality by repelling flies. This is why you will notice several meat vendors in these pictures using both candles and tube lamps for their stall's lighting. As most of these vendors do not live nearby, there is also the ease of carrying to consider: fluorescent tube lamps far are less portable and more fragile than candles.
